## Features
_Run all your data request unit tests offline_ ðŸŽ‰

- [x] Create mocked data requests based on an URL
- [x] Create mocked data requests based on a file extension
- [x] Works with `URLSession` using a custom protocol class
- [x] Supports popular frameworks like `Alamofire`

## Usage

Unit tests are written for the `Mocker` which can help you to see how it works.

### Activating the Mocker
The mocker will automatically be activated for the default URL loading system like `URLSession.shared` after you've registered your first `Mock`. 

##### Custom URLSessions
To make it work with your custom `URLSession`, the `MockingURLProtocol` needs to be registered:

```swift
let configuration = URLSessionConfiguration.default
configuration.protocolClasses = [MockingURLProtocol.self]
let urlSession = URLSession(configuration: configuration)
```

##### Alamofire
Quite similar like registering on a custom `URLSession`.

```swift
let configuration = URLSessionConfiguration.af.default
configuration.protocolClasses = [MockingURLProtocol.self]
let sessionManager = Alamofire.Session(configuration: configuration)
```

### Register Mocks
##### Create your mocked data
It's recommend to create a class with all your mocked data accessible. An example of this can be found in the unit tests of this project:

```swift
public final class MockedData {
    public static let botAvatarImageResponseHead: Data = Bundle(for: MockedData.self).url(forResource: "Resources/Responses/bot-avatar-image-head", withExtension: "data")!.data
    public static let botAvatarImageFileUrl: URL = Bundle(for: MockedData.self).url(forResource: "wetransfer_bot_avater", withExtension: "png")!
    public static let exampleJSON: URL = Bundle(for: MockedData.self).url(forResource: "Resources/JSON Files/example", withExtension: "json")!
}
```

##### JSON Requests
``` swift
let originalURL = URL(string: "https://www.wetransfer.com/example.json")!
    
let mock = Mock(url: originalURL, dataType: .json, statusCode: 200, data: [
    .get : MockedData.exampleJSON.data // Data containing the JSON response
])
mock.register()

URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: originalURL) { (data, response, error) in
    guard let data = data, let jsonDictionary = (try? JSONSerialization.jsonObject(with: data, options: [])) as? [String: Any] else {
        return
    }
    
    // jsonDictionary contains your JSON sample file data
    // ..
    
}.resume()
```

##### Ignoring the query
Some URLs like authentication URLs contain timestamps or UUIDs in the query. To mock these you can ignore the Query for a certain URL:

``` swift
/// Would transform to "https://www.example.com/api/authentication" for example.
let originalURL = URL(string: "https://www.example.com/api/authentication?oauth_timestamp=151817037")!
    
let mock = Mock(url: originalURL, ignoreQuery: true, dataType: .json, statusCode: 200, data: [
    .get : MockedData.exampleJSON.data // Data containing the JSON response
])
mock.register()

URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: originalURL) { (data, response, error) in
    guard let data = data, let jsonDictionary = (try? JSONSerialization.jsonObject(with: data, options: [])) as? [String: Any] else {
        return
    }
    
    // jsonDictionary contains your JSON sample file data
    // ..
    
}.resume()
```

##### File extensions
```swift
let imageURL = URL(string: "https://www.wetransfer.com/sample-image.png")!

Mock(fileExtensions: "png", dataType: .imagePNG, statusCode: 200, data: [
    .get: MockedData.botAvatarImageFileUrl.data
]).register()

URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: imageURL) { (data, response, error) in
    let botAvatarImage: UIImage = UIImage(data: data!)! // This is the image from your resources.
}.resume()
```

##### Custom HEAD and GET response
```swift
let exampleURL = URL(string: "https://www.wetransfer.com/api/endpoint")!

Mock(url: exampleURL, dataType: .json, statusCode: 200, data: [
    .head: MockedData.headResponse.data,
    .get: MockedData.exampleJSON.data
]).register()

URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: exampleURL) { (data, response, error) in
	// data is your mocked data
}.resume()
```

##### Delayed responses
Sometimes you want to test if cancellation of requests is working. In that case, the mocked request should not finished directly and you need an delay. This can be added easily:

```swift
let exampleURL = URL(string: "https://www.wetransfer.com/api/endpoint")!

var mock = Mock(url: exampleURL, dataType: .json, statusCode: 200, data: [
    .head: MockedData.headResponse.data,
    .get: MockedData.exampleJSON.data
])
mock.delay = DispatchTimeInterval.seconds(5)
mock.register()
```

##### Redirect responses
Sometimes you want to mock short URLs or other redirect URLs. This is possible by saving the response and mock the redirect location, which can be found inside the response:

```
Date: Tue, 10 Oct 2017 07:28:33 GMT
Location: https://wetransfer.com/redirect
```

By creating a mock for the short URL and the redirect URL, you can mock redirect and test this behaviour:

```swift
let urlWhichRedirects: URL = URL(string: "https://we.tl/redirect")!
Mock(url: urlWhichRedirects, dataType: .html, statusCode: 200, data: [.get: MockedData.redirectGET.data]).register()
Mock(url: URL(string: "https://wetransfer.com/redirect")!, dataType: .json, statusCode: 200, data: [.get: MockedData.exampleJSON.data]).register()
```

##### Ignoring URLs
As the Mocker catches all URLs by default when registered, you might end up with a `fatalError` thrown in cases you don't need a mocked request. In that case you can ignore the URL:

```swift
let ignoredURL = URL(string: "www.wetransfer.com")!
Mocker.ignore(ignoredURL)
```

However if you need the Mocker to catch only mocked URLs and ignore every other URL, you can set the `mode` attribute to `.optin`. 

```swift
Mocker.mode = .optin
```

If you want to set the original mode back, you have just to set it to `.optout`.

```swift
Mocker.mode = .optout
```

##### Mock errors

You can request a `Mock` to return an error, allowing testing of error handling.

```swift
Mock(url: originalURL, dataType: .json, statusCode: 500, data: [.get: Data()],
     requestError: TestExampleError.example).register()

URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: originalURL) { (data, urlresponse, err) in
    XCTAssertNil(data)
    XCTAssertNil(urlresponse)
    XCTAssertNotNil(err)
    if let err = err {
        // there's not a particularly elegant way to verify an instance
        // of an error, but this is a convenient workaround for testing
        // purposes
        XCTAssertEqual("example", String(describing: err))
    }

    expectation.fulfill()
}.resume()
```

##### Mock callbacks
You can register on `Mock` callbacks to make testing easier.

```swift
var mock = Mock(url: request.url!, dataType: .json, statusCode: 200, data: [.post: Data()])
mock.onRequest = { request, postBodyArguments in
    XCTAssertEqual(request.url, mock.request.url)
    XCTAssertEqual(expectedParameters, postBodyArguments as? [String: String])
    onRequestExpectation.fulfill()
}
mock.completion = {
    endpointIsCalledExpectation.fulfill()
}
mock.register()
```

##### Mock expectations
Instead of setting the `completion` and `onRequest` you can also make use of expectations:

```swift
var mock = Mock(url: url, dataType: .json, statusCode: 200, data: [.get: Data()])
let requestExpectation = expectationForCompletingMock(&mock)
let completionExpectation = expectationForCompletingMock(&mock)
mock.register()

URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: URLRequest(url: url)).resume()

wait(for: [requestExpectation, completionExpectation], timeout: 2.0)
```

## Installation

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

To integrate Mocker into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '10.0'
use_frameworks!

target '<Your Target Name>' do
    pod 'Mocker', '~> 2.2.0'
end
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate Mocker into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "WeTransfer/Mocker" ~> 2.3.0
```

Run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built `Mocker.framework` into your Xcode project.

### Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code. Itâ€™s integrated with the Swift build system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies.

#### Manifest File

Add Mocker as a package to your `Package.swift` file and then specify it as a dependency of the Target in which you wish to use it.

```swift
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "MyProject",
    platforms: [
       .macOS(.v10_15)
    ],
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/WeTransfer/Mocker.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "2.3.0"))
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "MyProject",
            dependencies: ["Mocker"]),
        .testTarget(
            name: "MyProjectTests",
            dependencies: ["MyProject"]),
    ]
)
```

#### Xcode

To add Mocker as a [dependency](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app) to your Xcode project, select *File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency* and enter the repository URL.

#### Resolving Build Errors
If you get the following error: *cannot find auto-link library XCTest and XCTestSwiftSupport*, set the following property under Build Options from No to Yes.  
ENABLE_TESTING_SEARCH_PATHS to YES

### Manually

If you prefer not to use any of the aforementioned dependency managers, you can integrate Mocker into your project manually.

#### Embedded Framework

- Open up Terminal, `cd` into your top-level project directory, and run the following command "if" your project is not initialized as a git repository:

  ```bash
  $ git init
  ```

- Add Mocker as a git [submodule](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule) by running the following command:

  ```bash
  $ git submodule add https://github.com/WeTransfer/Mocker.git
  ```

- Open the new `Mocker ` folder, and drag the `Mocker.xcodeproj` into the Project Navigator of your application's Xcode project.

    > It should appear nested underneath your application's blue project icon. Whether it is above or below all the other Xcode groups does not matter.

- Select the `Mocker.xcodeproj` in the Project Navigator and verify the deployment target matches that of your application target.
- Next, select your application project in the Project Navigator (blue project icon) to navigate to the target configuration window and select the application target under the "Targets" heading in the sidebar.
- In the tab bar at the top of that window, open the "General" panel.
- Click on the `+` button under the "Embedded Binaries" section.
- Select `Mocker.framework`.
- And that's it!

  > The `Mocker.framework` is automagically added as a target dependency, linked framework and embedded framework in a copy files build phase which is all you need to build on the simulator and a device.
